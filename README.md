üí¨ Mistral RAG Chatbot: Context-Aware Conversational AI

Project Overview

This repository hosts a powerful, context-aware chatbot implemented using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework and the advanced Mistral Large Language Model (LLM).

The RAG architecture allows the chatbot to retrieve information from a private, designated knowledge base (e.g., PDFs, documentation, notes) and use it to ground its responses. This significantly reduces hallucinations and ensures answers are precise, factual, and relevant to the provided corpus.

Why Mistral and RAG?

Mistral LLM: Leveraged for its high performance, speed, and capability in complex reasoning tasks.

RAG Architecture: Overcomes the limitation of pre-trained models by accessing proprietary or specialized knowledge, making the chatbot highly practical for enterprise or specific domain use.

‚ú® Key Features

Knowledge Grounding: Chatbot responses are directly linked to documents in the knowledge base, ensuring factual accuracy.

Vectorized Search: Utilizes high-speed vector indexing and similarity search for instantaneous retrieval of relevant document chunks.

Custom Context: Easily update the chatbot's knowledge by adding new documents (PDFs, TXT, MD) to the source directory.

Intuitive Interface: A simple Python-based interface (e.g., CLI or Streamlit/Flask app) for seamless interaction.

Scalable: The RAG pipeline is modular, allowing for easy swapping of LLMs, embedding models, or vector stores.

üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the RAG Chatbot locally.

1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed and a working API key for accessing the Mistral LLM.

# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/FavianRajendra/Mistral-Chatbot-RAG.git](https://github.com/FavianRajendra/Mistral-Chatbot-RAG.git)
cd Mistral-Chatbot-RAG


2. Installation

Install all required dependencies.

# Assuming you have a requirements.txt file
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install key dependencies manually:
# pip install llama-index mistralai python-dotenv


3. Configure API Key

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your Mistral API key:

MISTRAL_API_KEY="YOUR_MISTRAL_API_KEY_HERE"


4. Index the Knowledge Base

You must first process your documents and build the vector index.

Place your documents (e.g., doc1.pdf, guide.txt) into the knowledge_base/ directory.

Run the indexing script (name inferred):

python index_documents.py
# This script converts documents into chunks and saves them as vectors in the local store.


5. Run the Chatbot

Start the main application script (name inferred):

python app.py
